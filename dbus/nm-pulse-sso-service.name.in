# NetworkManager VPN plugin descriptor for Pulse SSO
#
# This plugin provides browser-based SAML/SSO authentication for Pulse VPN.
# Authentication is handled by the auth-dialog which runs AS THE USER,
# then credentials are passed to the D-Bus service which runs openconnect.
#
# Note: This plugin does not have an editor component, so it won't appear
# in nm-connection-editor's "Add VPN" dialog. Create connections via nmcli
# or NixOS networking.networkmanager.ensureProfiles.
